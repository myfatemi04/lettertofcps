<strong><p>Dear FCPS School Board members and Virginia State Legislators,</p></strong>
<p>We, as current students of TJHSST, write to you today in response to the merit lottery proposal for TJ admissions. The board&rsquo;s proposition is rushed, unfair, and stands against the values of TJ. While I acknowledge that the lack of diversity at our school is an urgent issue, this proposal is not the answer.</p>
<p>The current application process is race-blind, upholds the values of meritocracy, and seeks to determine the individuals who are the most passionate about STEM. While I understand the current admissions process has many shortcomings, which I offer alternatives to, the new proposal fails to solve these issues and creates a plethora of new problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TJHSST is a unique community built on its passion for learning. I agree that everyone in Northern Virginia should be given a fair chance towards TJ&rsquo;s educational opportunities. The disadvantages that lower-income and minority students face arecreated far before an applicant sits down to take the TJ test, and that is the problem we, as a school, as a community, and as a state, need to address. In this letter, I detail alternative solutions for these disadvantages that I feel could effectively help TJ demographics better reflect those of Fairfax County in the long term.</p>
<h1><strong>Concerns with the current proposal</strong></h1>
<p><em>The proposed lottery process was first introduced to the public on September 15th, with a decision required to be made on October 8th. I would like the board to recognize the ramifications of rolling out such a sweeping policy on such a short timeline. The proposal is incredibly vague on many fronts and was not created with sufficient community input.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>The proposal is rushed and largely fails to take into account the opinions of members of the current TJ community.</strong></p>
<p>It was given three weeks in the public&rsquo;s eye, and I feel the timeline doesn&rsquo;t give an appropriate amount of time for the board to receive and process the much-needed community input that plays a crucial role in board proceedings. The normal town hall format would consist of a large meeting with many members of the community from all sides of the debate providing their input on any given policy, and due to the current pandemic, this is simply not possible, however, the alternative that the board has provided seems to be quite unequal to the community input provided during the normal town hall. The board and state have both hosted multiple &ldquo;town halls&rdquo; on virtual meeting platforms such as Zoom, which include minimal ways for community members to provide input on the proposal. These town halls have proven that the input provided during the meetings has been ignored, and hosts have explicitly stated that they will not be addressing questions posted in the Q&amp;A or Chatbox, and so I ask that the board commit to providing a better platform for students, parents, and other community members to provide their feedback and thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>The proposal is extremely vague.</strong></p>
<p>I do not know the weight of the SIS essays in the proposed admissions system, whether there are different priority lottery pathways, or if the lottery pathways are solely regional. Because these are not defined, those who support the lottery have no clear idea of what they are supporting. In addition, the lottery system is now subject to last-minute changes away from the public&rsquo;s eye, which is a poor decision to make considering the wide-spread implications of the system.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><em>The proposed process removes aspects of the TJHSST application process which I believe are equitable measures of a student&rsquo;s success.</em></p>
<p><strong>Admissions testing helps to select students who will thrive at TJ.</strong></p>
<p>The TJ experience is challenging for all students as many classes are extremely rigorous and require a strong drive for success. Admissions testing helps to select students who will be able to do well in these classes and succeed in the high-stress environment. The removal of a merit-based exam ignores the fact that the education quality across Fairfax County is not consistently rigorous, especially in core STEM classes such as Mathematics and Science. While changes in the admissions testing system are a step in the right direction, they don&rsquo;t resolve the deep-rooted inequities within FCPS school systems.</p>
<p><strong>Teacher recommendations and essays are one of </strong><strong>the most equitable ways</strong><strong> to understand a student beyond their test scores, and removing them is counterproductive.</strong></p>
<p>Students cannot take a prep class to show their passion for STEM to their teachers; the passion will be apparent to the teachers through extensive participation in class and the pursuit of complex subjects beyond the classroom. Letters of recommendation and SIS essays are also an essential way for students to demonstrate their aspirations and personality. Without this representation, students who demonstrate a passion for STEM but score poorly on tests would be overlooked during the application process.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The proposed process adds a significant amount of random chance that is blind to student merit</strong>.</p>
<p>Although the merit lottery system offers an equal chance of admission, accepted candidates will not necessarily be the most qualified.Rather than artificially bolstering diversity at TJ through random chance, I should be seeking to equalize applicant opportunities and chances of admission across all socioeconomic backgrounds <em>before</em> the application process. A merit lottery system is likely to stigmatize disadvantaged students, insinuating that they were accepted because of chance, not qualifications or effort. Accepted applicants may feel as if their hard work in middle school did not positively affect their admission, while rejected applicants may feel that their spot was &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; by someone less qualified.[4]</p>
<p><strong>Creating a lottery creates an influx of applicants who are not a great fit for TJ. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;In January 2016, millions of Americans bought $2 or $3 Powerball tickets for a chance at claiming a $1.5 billion jackpot, the largest in US history. The players were not particularly intent on winning the lottery&mdash; most didn&rsquo;t expect to walk away as billionaires, but the potential reward incentivized them to enter. Similarly, the proposed merit lottery has the potential to discourage students from working hard to earn admission as it will attract-- and accept-- applicants who are not fully prepared for the rigorous courses and as a result will be unable to succeed at TJ. This will likely end up fostering a more stressful environment for the TJ community. Additionally, teachers go to amazing lengths to help students who seek their assistance and the school is built around assisting those that want further guidance and opportunities. Admitting more students who are not interested in taking advantage of these resources only breeds a sense of apathy about pursuing one&rsquo;s interests and working together to solve problems; it not only harms the very foundation this school is built on but also fails to help students or teachers.</p>
<p><strong>The merit lottery system may not increase diversity/representation.</strong></p>
<p>The current TJ demographic is extremely disproportionate to the surrounding population, but not due to the admissions process. The number of Black and Latinx students who apply to TJ is also disproportionately low compared to that of Asian and Caucasian applicants. Under the proposed system, county demographics will still not be properly reflected if the number of applicants from these populations stay low. Unfortunately, there is a lack of input around the county from historically underrepresented populations about their views on TJ. Under the current proposal, success would remain hollow even if applicant numbers were to rise because these disadvantaged populations are still not given the resources to thrive at TJ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The regional quota system creates a synthetic version of diversity that only looks good on paper while creating additional problems.</em></p>
<p><strong>The quota system does not solve the diversity issue at its TJ. Those who have limited exposure to STEM are not likely to apply, much less do well at TJ.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Instead of restricting the number of acceptances for each region of Northern Virginia, I should be seeking to level the playing field. The reality is, by enforcing a regional quota, many highly qualified students who deserve to attend TJ would lose the opportunity to come. Selecting the student body through a lottery may increase TJ drop out rates and result in lowered standards and course depth to accommodate students who are not ready for the rigor of TJ. This will take away an essential part of what makes TJ special&mdash;its unique variety of advanced classes not offered in base schools. It might similarly also cause a decrease in the amount of interaction I can have with outside companies, as TJ students will no longer be able to meet the demands of the companies they interact with. I believe that when academic readiness and diversity throughout the county overlap, diversity within TJ will happen naturally. Instead of enforcing artificial quotas, I should seek to improve educational equity throughout the entire county. Diversity is not a number, it is an environment.</p>
<p><strong>Regional quotas give some applicants an unfair advantage based on where they live and may have consequences beyond diversity at TJ.</strong></p>
<p>The current proposal&rsquo;s lottery pathways have been organized in such a way thatIn the way that the lottery pathways have been organized, many schools with historically high TJ acceptance rates which often have large numbers of students accepted into TJproduce a large proportion of TJ acceptance are grouped together (for example, Carson and Cooper in Region 1 and Longfellow and Kilmer in Region 2) while schools that traditionally do not produce as many TJ acceptances have one regional pathway for themselves. This heavily increases competition in regions where there has traditionally been a larger amount of TJ applicants and acceptances and leads to more qualified applicants being barred from TJ while those who are less qualified would be accepted, simply because they live in a different region. Furthermore, as parents realize that living in a certain place could mean that their child would be at a disadvantage may cause them to move away from the place. This may have economic implications as well: as individuals move away from a certain area, many local businesses (even outside of those directly affected such as prep classes) within that area would subsequently suffer from the decrease in patronage</p>
<h1><strong>Our proposals</strong></h1>
<p><em>&ldquo;There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>~ Henry David Thoreau</em></p>
<p>The core principle of our proposals is two-fold: First, to try to level the playing field for disadvantaged students far earlier in the game. Yes, this proposal requires significant investment in schools that serve disadvantaged students. Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it will take more time than eliminating the admissions standards for TJ. Altering the TJ admissions process is a band-aid solution that fixes the problem on paper, but the inherent problem of educational inequity is still maintained throughout the county. I believe that our proposals will help to mitigate the overarching problem in the long term, and as a result, will also increase TJ&rsquo;s diversity while maintaining the educational excellence that makes TJ special.</p>
<p><strong>Increase targeted recruitment for TJ applicants at all regional middle schools</strong></p>
<p>Many middle schools, particularly ones in low-income areas, barely mention TJHSST applications, so I should be encouraging applications to TJ and especially encouraging people to pursue their goals in STEM. Schools that neglect to talk about TJ are doing a disservice to students who truly have a passion for STEM and would benefit from a rigorous high-level education like TJ. To significantly increase awareness of the possibility of applying to TJ, the Fairfax County School Board should consider making admission outreach mandatory for all middle schools in the county. Our proposal for implementing this is to have TJ student ambassadors be part of the outreach process, and help encourage middle schoolers, especially those that do not send many students to TJ, to apply. Further, information about admissions deadlines and content should be given directly to the student through their FCPS email.</p>
<p><strong>Remove the groupings based on &ldquo;capability&rdquo; between AAP and Gen-Ed in the early grades</strong></p>
<p>Separation based on intellect starts very early on in the public school process, as early as 1st and 2nd grades when students are divided into the Advanced Academics Program (AAP) and General Education (Gen-Ed). Teachers often state without any constraint that AAP students are expected to be &ldquo;more capable&rdquo; and learn at a &ldquo;faster pace&rdquo;. Additionally, despite the IOWA being required to be administered for everyone in the AAP program in 6th grade, it is not required for the Gen-Ed students. The majority of students are not even aware that the IOWA can be administered to students not enrolled in AAP. This single distinction prevents many students from applying to TJ and succeeding on the admissions test as passing the IOWA is required to take Algebra I in seventh grade, which is a prerequisite for getting into TJ. Those who take Algebra I in eighth grade are eligible to apply; however, the math portion of the test is written as if the student has already taken Algebra I when in reality those who take Algebra I in eighth grade have not covered the majority of the content yet. Overall, non-AAP students are at a much greater disadvantage because of a distinction made early on, preventing them from being best prepared to apply to and thrive at TJ.</p>
<p>Additionally, empirical studies done of FCPS indicate that the Gen-Ed students are often of ethnic minorities: 19% of the students in FCPS are eligible for level 4, but only 12% of black students and 7%[3] of Latinx students are included in this group<strong>. </strong>Unlike the current proposal for changing TJ admissions, this attacks the underlying problems and is built on providing equal opportunity rather than having random admission. Doing this will make the TJ admissions process more inclusive in the long term and will also help increase educational equity in FCPS as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Collect meaningful data from the minorities around the county about their views on TJ</strong></p>
<p>The current proposal is at best a rushed decision without consideration of any actual data. The highlight of the proposal seems to be that everything else has failed, but the universal problem is the lack of communication with those to whom it pertains. There have been some weak attempts to help create opportunities to help boost minority acceptance rates, but they were so poorly advertised that most FCPS students have never heard of them. Students in schools with fewer resources have never been asked how they view TJ or even if they have heard of TJ. Lacking such basic data means that any proposal is blindly shooting without having any real target. This is particularly true in the case of the merit lottery system since the lack of admissions for students of color could very likely be due to a lack of applicants. This means that the current system is most likely to inflate the white student populations while deflating the Asian populations, becoming almost the exact opposite of the goal. Simultaneously, it would guarantee that heavy feeder schools like Rachel Carson Middle School, where TJ is made commonly known to the students, would maintain its dominant feeder status.</p>
<p><strong>I agree that the application fee should be removed/reduced.</strong></p>
<p>I believe it would be a good way to create equal opportunity among the applicants.</p>
<p><strong>Make the test less preparable.</strong></p>
<p>While an admissions test is necessary, the current admissions test is flawed. Wealthier TJ applicants often attend private tutoring classes to prepare for the TJ admissions test. Creating a test that measures critical thinking, logic, and creative problem solving over standardized testing skills would help to eliminate the advantage that students who pay for private tutoring have. This was implemented for the Class of 2022 admissions with the introduction of the Quant-Q, and I saw noticeable differences in class demographics. This concept should be expanded and improved over time, as opposed to the single update that the Quant-Q brought.</p>
<p>Another idea to make the tests less preparable would be to create a test in which students are given a concept to learn for about 20-30 minutes, and then given one or more problems to solve using the concept which they were just taught. Many prestigious math competitions (ex. ARML, PuMAC, CMIMC) use a version of this testing structure in a round known as power rounds, where competitors are introduced to a brand-new scenario and must solve problems regarding the scenario, often without being able to use known information and instead of having to largely rely on their problem-solving skills. This idea can also be applied to topics within logic, science, and engineering; national competitions such as Science Olympiad (ex. The events Codebusters and Experimental Design) and Future Problem Solving both utilize events of such formats.</p>
<p><strong>Provide school profiles in each application to provide a more thorough understanding of the opportunities that each applicant has access to&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Offer more opportunities for one-on-one help within public schools</strong></p>
<p>Many students in higher-income neighborhoods have parents who attended higher-level education and can assist students with their coursework by teaching them or paying for classes. Not everyone&rsquo;s parents can teach or afford STEM classes, so this puts some students at a disadvantage as there are fewer opportunities for one-on-one help. In middle schools particularly, there should be more opportunities for students to get tutoring with their teachers outside of school hours. Additionally, teachers (especially those who teach STEM classes) should increase awareness of free websites and resources that could help the students understand the content and delve deeper into the subject. If sufficient resources to enrich students&rsquo; learning were made available to all who wanted to access them, then a fair admissions test would be much more effective at testing students&rsquo; empirical knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage and fund STEM programs in middle and elementary schools with higher populations of disadvantaged students.</strong></p>
<p>Just like with varsity sports, the slots should go to the most qualified students. For TJ, that currently heavily favors those who have the resources to prepare for the test and while you can certainly make the test less prep-able, no one will be able to eliminate the advantage that these students have. By funding more free programs in FCPS schools for students without these resources, you can give resources to disadvantaged students to help them be able to properly prepare for the tests and ensure that all the students that walk in on test day do so on an equal playing field and offers are given to students who truly have the greatest potential to succeed here.</p>
<p><strong>Create public makerspaces for STEM work.</strong></p>
<p>One of the reasons people have pointed out for feeling unwelcome or disadvantaged in STEM learning is that they had fewer opportunities to pursue STEM activities before middle and high schools. If Fairfax County can host public maker spaces for STEM, it will introduce people to STEM activities at a younger age and allow them to discover their passions. This will allow them to develop STEM skills at their own pace and realize if they want to pursue TJ from early on.</p>
<h1><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h1>
<p>I acknowledge that there is not an all-encompassing solution to foster a diverse learning environment at TJ. Superficial solutions may produce favorable results in the short-term, but they fail to properly address the root issue. The process will be long and tough, but with action from every corner of the community, it can be achieved.</p>
<p>I believe that instead of hastily trying to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; in more diversity at TJ, I should be starting from a fundamental level to make education an experience that allows everyone an equal opportunity; only then will diversity within the TJ community flourish naturally.</p>{{form.message}}<br />
<p><strong>I hope the board will reconsider accepting the proposed changes to the TJ Admissions process and seek solutions that will address the root of the diversity issue at our school. Thank you.</strong></p><br /> Sincerely, <br>{{form.name}}</div>
